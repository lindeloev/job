Description: Call `job::job({<code here>})` to run R code as an RStudio job and keep your console free in the meantime. This is useful for testing long-running chunks of code, to organize results using the Jobs GUI, or to test code in a clean environment. Two RStudio Addins can be used to run selected code as a job.
