Description: Call `job::job({<code here>})` to run R code as an RStudio job and keep your console free in the meantime. This allows for a productive workflow while testing (multiple) long-running chunks of code. It can also be used to organize results using the RStudio Jobs GUI or to test code in a clean environment. Two RStudio Addins can be used to run selected code as a job.
